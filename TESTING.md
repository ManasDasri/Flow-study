# Validation and coverage

The UI refinement has repeatable checks across every shipped JavaScript module, the HTTP server, both HTML pages, all five themes, and the supplied database schemas. This is a coverage inventory, not a claim that every possible state or production environment has been tested.

## Run the checks

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
```

The browser runner starts an ephemeral local server and closes it after checking the complete journey. It intercepts Supabase and media-provider traffic and uses synthetic media. Screenshots in assets/ui-preview use these fixtures. Runtime screenshots and results go to output/playwright. Failures also produce a trace ZIP and screenshot.

The runner executes ui-smoke.js and then tools-layout.js in one browser context. The layout check covers ten viewport sizes, including 1366x600 and 1440x500, verifies composer and fullscreen control bounds, checks that labels fit inside their buttons, and exercises Shift+Enter versus Enter. It also verifies the outlined f. SVG favicon loads without a runtime font dependency.

For interactive debugging with Playwright CLI, start npm start, open its local URL, and run both scripts in the same session:

```sh
playwright-cli open http://localhost:3000/login.html
playwright-cli run-code --filename=scripts/ui-smoke.js
playwright-cli run-code --filename=scripts/tools-layout.js
```

Database checks require an isolated local PostgreSQL server owned by a test superuser named `flow_test`. They connect only to `127.0.0.1`, create disposable `flow_ui_*` databases, and remove those databases afterward. Do not point these checks at Supabase or a shared database.

```sh
FLOW_TEST_PGPORT=55439 npm run test:db
```

## Continuous integration

The workflow in .github/workflows/ci.yml runs on PRs targeting main, pushes to main (including merges), and manual dispatch. Node tests run on 22, 24, and 26; migration tests use an isolated PostgreSQL 17 service; Chromium runs the browser suite; the production dependency audit fails on high/critical findings. Browser diagnostics are uploaded even on failure and retained for seven days. Configure required status checks in GitHub branch rules if merges should be blocked.

The test server clears AI and Twilio provider credentials before loading Express. CI never needs production secrets. The PostgreSQL service password is a disposable fixture value.

## Local stress results

The successful browser runs rendered 500 task rows through five reconciliations, delivered 1,000 fixture messages while retaining the most recent 300, and created 16 simulated partner tiles. Local WebRTC reached `connected` and received one audio and one video track. The suite finished without uncaught browser errors.

The HTTP checks completed 100 concurrent local static requests. These small, isolated workloads validate behavior under those conditions. They are not a benchmark of hosted capacity, a cross-network media test, or a sustained production load test. Timings depend on the test machine.

## Supabase compatibility

The supplied older schema defines `verify_room_pin`, TEXT room references, and permissive task policies. The current app expects `join_room`, participant membership, profiles, and task assignment.

For an existing database, review and stage these migrations in order:

1. `sql/002_profiles.sql`
2. `sql/003_task_assignment.sql`
3. `sql/004_room_access_compatibility.sql`

Migration 004 preserves existing rows and publications, maps recognized legacy room-code references to UUID strings, backfills membership for existing task/session authors, and replaces legacy task policies with participant checks. Unknown room references remain intact and require review. Historical author fields come from the old schema and should be reviewed before relying on their backfilled memberships.

`sql/schema.sql` is a destructive bootstrap script, not an upgrade path for an existing database. No migration was executed against the live Supabase project during this work.

## Remaining integration checks

- Validate the actual deployed schema and policies rather than assuming the shared SQL exactly matches it.
- Exercise real authentication/email delivery, live database mutations, and Supabase subscription recovery on a staging project.
- Test physical camera/microphone permissions and calls across separate devices and restrictive networks, using configured TURN credentials.
- Verify private Realtime authorization separately: table RLS and the join RPC do not establish private Broadcast-channel authorization by themselves.
- Check paid AI/TURN success paths with staging credentials and agreed request limits.
- Run Safari/Firefox, assistive-technology, long-duration, and hosted load checks before making broader compatibility/capacity claims.
